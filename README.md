# Diversity-Inclusion-Initiatives
Power BI - Dashboard Creation assoiciated with PWC


Project Overview:
In this project, I undertook a significant endeavor within the PwC job stimulation program to advance Diversity & Inclusion initiatives. My goal was to create a comprehensive Diversity & Inclusion dashboard using Power BI, enabling data-driven decision-making and fostering an inclusive workplace culture.

Key Achievements:

Dashboard Creation: I single-handedly designed and developed a dynamic Power BI dashboard dedicated to Diversity & Inclusion metrics. This dashboard served as a powerful tool to visualize and monitor critical diversity-related data.

KPI Definition: The success of the project hinged on meticulous Key Performance Indicator (KPI) definition. I carefully selected and defined KPIs that accurately measured our organization's diversity and inclusion efforts, including:

Tracking the number of men and women in the organization.
Monitoring leavers and analyzing turnover.
Calculating the percentage of employees promoted during the fiscal year 2021.
Evaluating the percentage of women promoted.
Measuring the percentage of male and female hires.
Assessing overall turnover.
Analyzing average performance ratings for both men and women.
Impact and Continuous Improvement:

This project has empowered PwC to actively nurture a diverse and inclusive workplace culture. The dashboard provides actionable insights into key diversity metrics, allowing for informed decision-making.

By using the dashboard, PwC can continuously monitor progress and make data-backed decisions to improve diversity representation, promotions, and the overall employee experience.

This initiative underscores PwC's unwavering commitment to Diversity & Inclusion, and my independent efforts reflect the organization's dedication to creating an inclusive workplace where all employees can thrive.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, my project on the Diversity & Inclusion dashboard, developed using Power BI within the PwC job stimulation program, highlights the critical role of data in promoting diversity and fostering an inclusive workplace culture. It showcases my ability to take initiative and make a meaningful impact within the organization. This project serves as a testament to PwC's commitment to diversity and inclusion, ultimately benefiting both employees and clients by creating a more inclusive and diverse environment.
